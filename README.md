nodejs raspberry pi camera application to upload images to server. It is designed to be setup once and left alone. Additional configuration will be added to the server side.

> You will need a server to receive the image stream generated by the camera. I recommend [raspberry-pi-camera-server](https://github.com/pcnate/raspberry-pi-camera-server)
